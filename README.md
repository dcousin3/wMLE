# weighted-Maximum likelihood estimation

These folders contains programs in three languages
(matlab, Mathematica and R) which estimate the 
3-parameter Weibull distribution parameters using the
weighted-maximum likelihood method.

All three scripts requires weights that are precomputed
to gain speed. They are computed for some sample sizes 
(1 to 100) and --regarding the third weight-- for some
putative population shape parameter. The weights may 
be expanded in the near future.

These scripts should be considered the official implementation
of the w-MLE technique. If implementation in other programming 
language are required, let me know by email or by opening
an issue.
